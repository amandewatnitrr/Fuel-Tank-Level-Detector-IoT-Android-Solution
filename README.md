# Fuel-Tank-Level-Detector-IoT-Android-Solution
The Project aims to send the status of the fuel level in the tank and send the data to an Android App using NodeMCU ESP 8266 (12-E) module and an ultrasonic sensor that measures the fluid level based on the Echo recieved. 

Due to COVID-19 Issues the Ultrasonic Sensor is replaced with DHT Sensor.

# Hardware Requirements
1. Arduino NodeMCU ESP8266
2. DHT

# Software Requirements
1. Arduino
2. ThingSpeak

This Project has been developed in Unofficial Collaboration with Aryan Sarkar, Shruti Rawal, Reecha Singh and me for Smart India Hackathon 2020
